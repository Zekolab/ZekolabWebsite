            <p>In the event of a serious breach of any of the provisions of these GCU, ZEKOLAB and the Users may terminate the GCU without notice or prior notice.</p>
            <p>For example, the following is considered a serious breach of contract that will result in the termination of these Terms of Use by operation of law, without this list being exhaustive:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>For the User:
                    <ul>

                        <li>bad faith on the part of the User and/or lack of willingness to use the Platform in accordance with its purpose;</li>
                        <li>repeated conflicting interactions with other Users, either online or physically in the context of a matchmaking process;</li>
                        <li>providing false information or using the Platform for illegal purposes.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    </ul>
                </li>

            <h3>9.5. Effects of termination/suspension</h3>
